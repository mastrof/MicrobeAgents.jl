    acf(x, lags=0:size(x,1)-1)
Evaluate the autocorrelation function (acf) of a signal `x` at timelags `lags`.
If `lags` is unspecified, the acf is evaluated for all available time points.

The signal `x` can be an `AbstractVector` or an `AbstractMatrix`.
In the latter case, it is assumed that each column represents a distinct signal
and each row a timepoint. The acf is then evaluated for each individual
timeseries and the results are averaged together.

The result is *not* normalized. If `f = acf(x)`, just evaluate
`f./f[1]` to normalize it.
