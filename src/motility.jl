"""
    Motility(motile_states::NTuple{N,MotileState}, rates...)
Construct a `Motility` from a sequence of `MotileState`s and their transition `rates`.

`motile_states` must be a tuple of `MotileState` instances.
`rates` must be specified in the form `(i => j, p)` where `i` is the index
of the starting state (as ordered in the `motile_states` tuple), `j`
is the index of the state towards which the transition occurs, and `p`
is the probability that, after the duration of `i` is over,
the transition occurs towards the state `j`.
It is not necessary to indicate impossible transitions; any pair
`i => j` which is not explicitly specified is assumed to have a
transition probability `p=0`.

For example, if we want to define a 3-state motility, composed by a
slow but long run, a tumble, and a fast but short run, where the two runs
can only transition towards the tumble, but the tumble can transition
with probability 30% towards the slow run and 70% towards the fast run,
we will call:

    Motility((Run(10.0, 2.0), Tumble(), Run(60.0, 0.5)),
        (1 => 2, 1.0),
        (2 => 1, 0.3), (2 => 3, 0.7),
        (3 => 2, 1.0)
    )

Some default constructors for common motility patterns are provided:
`RunTumble`, `RunReverse`, `RunReverseFlick`, `RunStop`
