MicrobeAgents.jl (previously Bactos.jl) is a Julia framework for agent-based
simulations of microbial behavior (especially bacteria), built on
the amazing [Agents.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/Agents.jl).
MicrobeAgents.jl extends and re-exports a minimal set of Agents.jl
functions and structures to be used as a stand-alone package, but it is
recommended to use it alongside Agents.jl for extra niceties.

The package is still at an early stage of intense development.
Contributions, requests and suggestions are more than welcome.

**To use the latest development version of MicrobeAgents it's required to manually install
the latest version of Agents first (`]add Agents#main`).**

## Main features
- Multiple swimming strategies (run-tumble, run-reverse, run-reverse-flick) with tunable parameters, and possibility to implement your own with minimal effort
- Classical and modern models of chemotaxis (Berg-Purcell, Celani-Vergassola, Xie, Brumley)
- Support for arbitrary concentration fields, both numerical and analytical
- Compatible with DifferentialEquations.jl for parallel integration of external fields and bacterial behavior
- Motility in complex environments through Agents.Pathfinding
- Analysis routines for standard quantities of interest (MSD, autocorrelation functions, drift velocity)
